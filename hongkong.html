        <p>Hong Kong including other cities such as China and Macau travel photos will be included here. Although I can include all three places as the title 
            I think that it is just too long. Therefore I will just stamp Hong Kong there and include a series of photos. I think that the best about my last trip 
            to Asia was the fact I did get to go to all three cities. Starting with Hong Kong and ending it with Hong Kong as well. As for Hong Kong I have gone there 
            for about a a week and half then travled towards China and ended up in Macau for one whole day. In addition we ususally go there for about two weeks so  
            because of that going to so many places all at once is really interesting. When it comes to traveling there are still so many places that I haven't really 
            gone to but
